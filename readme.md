# Cone

## WARNING : this package is not fully-functionnal, has issues, and should not be used in production ! Unfortunately I got no time to fix it right now...
## Feel free to submit pull request though

Generate a **cone** mesh, renderer and collider, **on the fly**.

Be able to use a **Cone**, that is missing into the native **Unity's primitives**.

Use the regular **create** menu and select **3D Object > Cone**, then customize the cone with the **Inspector** parameters.

***Using another shader than unlit give weird behavior with some parameters configuration. Hopefully a fix will come later.***
